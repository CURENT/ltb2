# Large-Scale Testbed

Large-scale Testbed (LTB) is a highly integrated, closed loop platform for power system fast-prototyping. LTB includes independent packages: a) ANDES: power system simulator, b) AMS: pwoer market simulator, c) DiME: distributed messaging environment, d) Vis: visualizer. Towards one-stop solution, LTB packages can be used individually and federatedly. AMS is included in the newly released v2.0.

# Why LTB

LTB platform enables power system *dynamic simualiton*, *market simulation*, *geographical visualization*, *real-time simualtion*, and ***dispatch-dynamic co-simulaiton***.

*Getting trouble with dispatch in a dynamic simulation?* The interoperability of ANDES for scheduling supports secured dispatch in a dynamic simulation.

*Getting lost in the APIs of simulators?* Easy-to-use ANDES and AMS can be your last stop to prototype new algorithms and models.

*Looking for a geographical visualization?* LTBVis allows geographical visualization with multiple option.

*Interested in real-time close-loop simulation?* LTB has integrated simulators and communication environments.
