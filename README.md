# Large-Scale Testbed

Large-scale Testbed (LTB) is a highly integrated, closed loop platform for power system fast-prototyping.

# Why LTB

This work enables power system dynamic simualiton, power market simulation, geographical visualization, real-time simualtion, and **dispatch-dynamic co-simulaiton**.

Here are some videos that show the magic of LTB:

Using AMS for LMP-based cyber attack detection

# LTB structure

LTB includes following packages:

- ANDES: power system simulator
- AMS: pwoer market simulator
- DiME: Distributed Messaging Environment
- Vis: Visualizer

Towards one-stop solution, LTB packages can be used individually and federatedly.
